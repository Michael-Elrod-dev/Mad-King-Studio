              <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Hey, I&apos;m Michael! I&apos;m a full-time software developer, but
                in my free time I&apos;ve been diving into game development. To be
                honest, I&apos;m pretty much a beginner at this. 
                Sure, I tinkered with a few small projects back in
                college, but nothing serious. Now that life has settled down a
                bit, I&apos;ve decided to start actually creating completed games under 
                the name Mad King Studio.
              </p>

              <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                I&apos;ve also decided to make all my
                games going forward completely open source (except for the art and music I buy
                from talented artists). Honestly, it started as a random
                idea, but the more I thought about it, the cooler it got. As a beginner myself, 
                the idea of being able to peek behind the curtain of a game&apos;s development,
                learn from the code, suggest improvements, or even contribute
                features myself is wild to me.
              </p>

              <p className="text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                I don&apos;t have any strong opinions 
                about software freedom. I just think it would be genuinely
                awesome to build something alongside a community of other
                developers, gamers, or just curious minds. Plus, sitting at my desk all day
                making a game alone can get boring. Come
                hang out, watch me struggle with physics, or maybe
                we&apos;ll create something amazing together.
